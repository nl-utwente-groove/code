 * Allows to choose a random element from a sequence without storing all the
 * elements of the sequence. On can "show" objects from the sequence to the
 * chooser and, at each moment, the chooser can give back one random element
 * among those it has seen up to now. It also guarantees that all seen elements
 * can be picked with equal probability.
 *
 * A typical usage is to show to the chooser some number of elements, and then
 * ask for a random representative. Note that two successive calls to
 * {@link #pickRandom()} will return the same element. This cannot be avoided if
 * one does not want to store the whole sequence.
