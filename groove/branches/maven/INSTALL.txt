To install and compile this project, you have to obtain the Maven dependencies first. These consist of

- Globally available libraries
- Local libraries

For the first category, you need to nothing, as Maven will be able to get them from the central repository.
For the second category, however, you first have to install the libraries into your local Maven repository (on your machine).
Eclipse launch configurations have been provided for this, in the launch directory. Eclipse should find these automatically,
and allow you to run them from the "Run" menu.

In Eclipse, to do all local installs in one fell swoop, use

  GROOVE install local mvn-deps

Alternatively, you can run the required Maven commands from the command line. Instructions are included
in the .pom-files under lib/pom.

The local installs need only be done once (on any machine where you want to build GROOVE).

A somewhat more extensive explanation is given below.


GROOVE Maven build
==================

Globally available libraries
----------------------------
Many libraries can be found automatically by Maven. For those the pom.xml need only specify

<dependency>
	<groupId>x</groupId>
	<artifactId>y</artifactId>
	<version>n</version>
</dependency>

which will ensure that package y-n.jar will be obtained from group x (which needs to be recognised by Maven)

Local libraries
---------------
If a library cannot be found automatically by Maven, but for other purposes you want Maven to treat it in the same way as the globally available libs, you first need to add it to your local Maven repository. That is a step that needs to be taken once in your build environment, for every such library.

Adding a library to your local Maven repository is called *installing* the library, in Maven terminology. This can be done by the Maven instruction

mvn install:install-file
  -Dfile=path-to-jar/y.jar
  [-Dsources=path-to-sources/y-src.zip
  -DgroupId=x 
  -DarctifactId=y 
  -Dversion=n

where path-to-jar/y.jar is the path to the actual jar file, from the working directory (and the optional path-to-sources/y-src.zip the path to a sip file containing sources, if they are available).

For the GROOVE local libraries, help has been provided by

* Collecting the groupId, artifactId and version (and dependencies) in a single y.pom file, stored in the subdirectory lib/pom of GROOVE
* Creating a m2 launch configuration that invokes the above install-file goal
* Adding that m2 launch configuration to the launch group "GROOVE install local mvn-deps"
