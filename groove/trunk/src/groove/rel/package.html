The <tt>rel</tt> package offers functionality for
<ul>
<li> <i>Variables</i>, which are <tt>String</tt>s evaluated to <tt>Label</tt>s, occurring as named wildcards in regular expressions;
</li>
<li> Binary <i>relations</i> between nodes in a graph;
</li>
<li> <i>Regular expressions</i> and their evaluation. Regular expressions can be evaluated over graphs; this yields a binary relation 
over the nodes of the graph, where two nodes are related if the graph contains a path accepted by the regular expression.
</li>
</ul>
