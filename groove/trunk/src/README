1. Unpacking

	After unpacking the archive, you get a src direcory which contains
	the sources of the GROOVE project, the LICENSE agreement, a
	GNU makefile as well as some building scripts and this README file.
	
	
2. Requirements

	Building the GROOVE tool requires a Java 5 compiler. 
	Moreover, you will need the following libraries.
		- castor v. 0.9.5.2 or later, http://www.castor.org/
		- jgraph v. 5.2.1 or later, http://www.jgraph.com/
		- jgraphaddons v. 1.0.4 or later, http://www.jgraph.com/
		- xerces v. 2.6.0 or later, http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/
		- junit v. 3.8.1 or later (Only needed if using the test set.), http://www.junit.org/
		
	The provided makefile expects to find these libraries into a
	folder named lib located in the GROOVE src directory. 
	
3. Building GROOVE

3.1. Setting environment mariables
	We provide a makefile for building the tool. It uses the scripts 
	ljavac and ljavadoc for envocing java compiler with the appropriate
	source and class paths.
	
	If the java compiler is not in your path, or you want to use a particular
	java compiler, then set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the
	Java Devolopment Kit directory.
	Example:
		- for a bash shell and JDK directory being /opt/jdk1.5, use command
			> export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.5
		- for a csh shell and JDK directory being /opt/jdk1.5, use command
			> setenv JAVA_HOME /opt/jdk1.5
			
3.2. Building

	The easiest way for building the tool is using the provided makefile.
	First change directory to the GROOVE src directory.
		- building the main tools Editor Generator Simulator Imager
			> make -f makefile core
		- building the main tools and the test set (JUnit library needd)
			> make -f makefile all
		- building the Java Doc documentation
			> make -f makefile doc
			
4. Running GROOVE

	For running GROOVE you may use the provided scripts. If the java virtual
	machine (java command) is not in the path, or you want to use a
	particular java virtual machine, then set the JAVA_HOME variable to
	the corresponding java distribution directory.
